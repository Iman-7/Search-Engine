Building a Search Engine using C++

## User Guide
To use the program properly and to make the .exe file work:

	- You need to edit ALL the paths of the files either input or output files to 
		the path of the folder in which you will store the files.
	- Also, if you wish, you can adjust the significant change number in the PageRank function 
		to fit the number of pages that you are using.
